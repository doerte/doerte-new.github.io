It has been more than 5 years since my last blog post and 4 years since the last major (design) makeover of my website. Therefore, it was about time, I started to work on my website again. I have completely redesigned the website, using a bootstrap theme by [Bootstraptaste](http://bootstraptaste.com/). Therefore, my site is now completely responsive. 

I also "redesigned" the content of the website. I cleaned up old things - who needs to know where my 2011 PhD defense took place - and also put a new structure into place, splitting my site into different "content" areas. I still need to see whether I like this formula, but for now I leave it like this.
