#### Programming 

During my time at the Groningen Center of Expertise for Language and Communication Disorders, I worked at the development of an iPad app for testing verb processing. I made a prototype that we showed at different occasions and tried out with patients for collecting normative data. I also programmed an app for a colleague to collect her experimental data (see [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02687038.2014.977217?journalCode=paph20#.VUsmQfmqpBc) and [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02687038.2014.902916?journalCode=paph20)). These apps were written in Objective-C.

During my PhD research, I used Ruby scripts to clean-up my ERP data. More information on that can be found in my [blog post](/work/2010/09/29/ERP.html) regarding this issue.

In my free time, I enjoy to extend my programming skills and more theoretical understanding on this matter. I have followed some online courses on this subject. I have also read/am reading some textbooks and just recently started to get more acquainted with the Go programming language. Currently I'm working on my first web app written in Go.
